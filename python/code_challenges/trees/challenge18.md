## Tree Fizz Buzz

---
## Challenge
Write a function called fizz-buzz-tree which takes a k-ary tree as an argument , and create a new tree with the same structure as the original but the value modified as follow :

- If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz” .
- If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz” .
- If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz” .
- If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String .

Return a new tree .
